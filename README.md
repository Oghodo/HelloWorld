# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I am focused on strengthening my problem-solving skills and becoming comfortable working with real development tools. This project helps me practice the full software creation process, from writing code to publishing it online and explaining how it works.

This software is a simple Python program that prints the classic message "Hello World" to the screen. It demonstrates how to create a basic script, run it in a development environment, and verify that everything is working correctly.

The purpose of this software is to build familiarity with Python, practice using GitHub for version control, and develop confidence in creating and sharing software projects.
